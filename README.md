# The Elmish Book

The Elmish Book is a practical guide to building modern web applications in F# from first principles. Using the  Fable compiler we will take our F# code and turn it into Javascript. This allows our F# code to run anywhere where JavaScript runs, whether it is the browser, [Node.js][nodejs] or other runtimes. Fable is designed with interoperability in mind, that makes it simple to re-use and integrate with the vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries as we will see later on in the book.

Our main focus will be building client applications for the browser. We will start by learning the development workflow around client applications, slowly understanding the tooling and the hybrid nature of Fable projects since we will be both using [.NET][dotnet] and Node.js tools for development.

Using the Elmish library, we will build and design our applications following The Elm Architecture: A beautiful pattern for building truly modular user interfaces as popularized by the [Elm][elm] programming language. We will spend a great portion of the book talking about, understanding and building applications that follow this architecture starting from the very scratch until it becomes second nature to the reader; hence the name of this book.
