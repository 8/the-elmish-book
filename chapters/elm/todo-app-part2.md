# To-Do List Application: Part 1

In this section, we will continue to build upon what we did in the previous section and upgrade our To-Do list application such that it is able to mark To-Do items as completed as well as the ability to delete them from the list. It will look like the following:

<div style="width:100%">
  <div style="margin: 0 auto; width:65%;"> 
    <resolved-image source="/images/elm/todo-part2.gif" />      
  </div>
</div>
