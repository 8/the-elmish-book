# Introduction

In this chapter, we will get started with The Elm Architecture (TEA). I will be explaining the relevant concepts using bite-sized examples to get a feeling to how things work. By the end of the chapter, you should be familiar with terminology such as "state", "update", "render", "react" and "program". The examples themselves might not be *that* useful just yet because we will not be using side-effects but at the end of the chapter we will be combining what we have learned and put it into practice to build a To-Do List application: the hello world of every user interface framework.

Aside from The Elm Architecture, we will look at the tools use are using, the role they play and how the project is structured. Let's jump right in!
