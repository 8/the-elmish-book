# Introduction

In this chapter, we will get started with the basics of The Elm Architecture (TEA) using Elmish. We will go through the relevant concepts using bite-sized examples to get a feeling to how things work. Once we get a bit familiar with the concepts we'll start building the hello world application of every UI library: a To-Do list application which will be the perfect example to combine all the concepts demonstrated in the chapter. Afterwards, you will be tasked to add more features to the application we built to help internalize the concepts even more.

Aside from The Elm Architecture, we will look at the tools we are using, the role they play and how the project is structured. Let's jump right in!
