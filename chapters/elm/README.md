# Introduction

In this chapter, we will get started with The Elm Architecture (TEA). We will do so by first explaining the relevant concepts and demonstrate them with example small projects, starting with *yet another* counter application and work our way towards a more complex application like a To-Do List application. 

Aside from The Elm Architecture, we will look at the tools use are using, the role they play and how the project is structured. Let's jump right in!
