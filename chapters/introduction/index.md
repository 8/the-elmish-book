# Introduction

The aim of this book is to give the readers in-depth knowledge on how to build client applications in F#, specifically by using the [Fable](fable.io) compiler that takes our F# code and turns it into modern Javascript, thus allowing our F# code to be run inside any Javascript runtime whether it is the browser, node or others. See [About Fable](about-fable.md) to learn more.

Our main focus will be building client applications for the browser. We will start by learning the basic workflow around client applications, understand the tooling and the hybrid nature of Fable applications since we will be both using [dotnet](https://dotnet.github.io/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) tools for developement. 

Next comes the Elmish part! We will build and design our applications using The Elm Architecture: A beautiful pattern for building truely modular user interfaces as popularized by the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) programming language. We will spend a great portion of the book talking about, understanding and building applications that follow this architecture staring from the very scratch till it becomes a second nature to the reader; hence the name of this book.

Once we have we are comfortable on the client side, we will take our skills up a notch and build client-server applications since client-server interactions are a vital part of such applications.
