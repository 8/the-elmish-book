# Introduction

The Elmish Book is a practical guide on how to build advanced client applications in F#, specifically using the [Fable](http://fable.io) compiler that will take our F# code and turn it into modern Javascript. This allows our F# code is to run anywhere where Javascript runs, whether it is the browser, node or others. Fable is designed with interoperability in mind that makes it really simple to re-use and integrate the vast ecosystem of Javascript libraries as we will see later on in the book.
  
Our main focus will be building client applications for the browser. We will start by learning the developement workflow around client applications, understand the tooling and the hybrid nature of Fable projects since we will be both using [dotnet](https://dotnet.github.io/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) tools for developement. 

Next comes the Elmish part, which I am very excited about already! We will build and design our applications using The Elm Architecture: A beautiful pattern for building truely modular user interfaces as popularized by the [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) programming language. We will spend a great portion of the book talking about, understanding and building applications that follow this architecture starting from the very scratch till it becomes a second nature to the reader; hence the name of this book.
