# Introduction

This chapter provides a gentle introduction to Fable development by building Hello World and other small applications. We will not be using Elm architecture just yet. Instead, we will use the available browser APIs, mainly the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) API to play around a bit with elements on the browser pages and build small user interfaces.
