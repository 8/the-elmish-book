# Introduction

 This chapter provides a gentle introduction to Fable development by building a Hello World and other small applications. We will not be using the Elm architecture just yet, instead, we will use the available browser APIs, particularty the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) API to play around a bit with elements on the browser pages and build small user interfaces.
