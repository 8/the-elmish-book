# Chapters Overview

The book is divided into the following chapters. It is recommended that you read them in chronological order. Here is a brief overview of the content of each section:

### Chapter 1: Understanding Fable
This chapter is devoted to getting started and understanding the development workflow around Fable projects. Starting with small examples that run in the browser, we will examine the different tools that we will be using and discuss the role they play within a Fable project.

### Chapter 2: The Elm Architecture
This chapter is concerned with understanding the basics of the Elm architecture like application state, rendering HTML from the state, messages, event handlers, using CSS, conditional rendering, the dispatch loop and how it all fits in F# with the Elmish library. The different concepts are applied using small applications.

### Chapter 3: Commands In Elmish
This chapter dives deeper into Elmish introducing an essential piece of Elm Architecture which is the commands. Using commands, we will be able to utilise asynchronous updates and asynchronous operations in Elmish applications and apply the techniques learnt to understand and implement HTTP operations from scratch. Once we know about HTTP and data communication, we can move forward to learning how to manipulate and work with the data as JSON in our applications.
