# Contributing

In order to improve the quality of this book, I need your help. The easiest way to contribute it to actually read the book and see where the content could be improved: whether you simply found a typo or thought that a sentence is phrased in a confusing manner, please do file [an issue](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/the-elmish-book/issues) about it if there isn't already one. It will help everyone who is learning from this book.

Experts can help me as well in the more naunced aspects of the material such the *placement* and order of sections and the way the content progresses as the reader moves from one chapter to another. Another great way to contribute is by suggesting ideas of sample *full* applications to demonstrate and adding interesting exercises to them.
