# Contributing

To improve the quality of this book, I need your help. The easiest way to contribute is to read the book and see where the content can be developed: whether you simply found a typo or thought that a sentence is phrased confusingly, please do file [an issue](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/the-elmish-book/issues) about it if there isn't already one. It will help everyone who is learning from this book.

Experts can help me as well in the more nuanced aspects of the material such the *placement* and order of sections and the way the content progresses as the reader moves from one chapter to another. Another great way to contribute is by suggesting ideas of sample *full* applications to demonstrate and adding engaging exercises to them.

I look forward to hearing your feedback.
