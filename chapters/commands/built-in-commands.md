# Built-In Commands

The `Cmd` module includes a bunch of useful built-in commands that we don't have to build ourselves.

Another reason for implementing `Cmd.fromAsync` is because I personally am not a big fan of the API provided in the `Cmd` module to work with asynchronous expressions. Putting that aside, let us explore what the built-in commands have to offer.
