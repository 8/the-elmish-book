# Audience

Naturally, the book is aimed at F# developers who wish to use their existing knowledge and skills in F# to build front-end apps. Except for a bit of Html and CSS, no prior experience is assumed concerning front-end development as I will to try to explain the concepts needed from the very scratch.

This book however is *not* an introduction to F# itself and I will assume you know the basics of language such as the general syntax, the concept of immutability, pattern matching and a bit of `Async`. I will try to keep it as simple as possible but this goes to say that I will not spend time explaining F# snippets unless deemed necessary.

There are great references to help you learn and easily get started with F#:
