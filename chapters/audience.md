# Audience

---------------------

Naturally, the book is aimed at F# developers who wish to use their existing knowledge and skills in F# to build front-end apps. No prior experience is assumed concerning front-end development as I will to try to explain the concepts needed from the very scratch.

That said, anyone who is familiar with the syntax of the ML family of languages like [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason) or [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) should be able to follow along with the book.

### I use TypeScript, why should I care?

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a wonderful language and since you use it, you already know the value of having a static type system for your code, that is why I believe you will appreciate the elegant type system that F# has to offer, along with other language constructs that encourage simple and correct code. As mentioned before, interoperability is one of Fable's main goals, almost everything you can do with typescript, you will be able to do in F# as well like interacting with third-party libraries, components and even consuming typescript from F# code.  

### Already an Elm expert, what's in Fable for me?
 
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) developers in particular might find F# with Fable a truely delightful experience, here are some of the reasons why, F#:
 - Is a general-purpose language with a vibrant and active community
 - Can be used both on client and server and share code between the two, see the awesome [SAFE-stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/) that combines several F# technologies into a coherent and pleasant web development story.
 - Is very close to Elm syntactically; low learning curve
 - Has excellent tooling, both [open source](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) and [professional](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) backed by Microsoft
 - Has the Elm architecture implemented as a library: Elmish
 - Can easily re-use the vast existing Javascript ecosystem of components, UI and pure libraries alike in Elmish applications. 


### PureScript dev here, should I learn Fable as well? 

No, you keep doing what you are already doing ;) 

Just kidding! F# and Fable are definitely worth a try even though if you are deep into functional programming!
