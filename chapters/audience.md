Naturally, the book is aimed at F# developers who wish to use their existing knowledge to build frontend apps. No prior experience is assumed concerning frontend developement as I will to try to explain the concepts needed from the very scratch.

That said, anyone who is familiar with the syntax of the ML family of languages like [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/ ) or [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason) should have no trouble following along with the book. 

Develpers of a foreign language like [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) might be interested in F# because of it's elegant functional nature, the powerful type system and the deep integration with the Javascript tools.
