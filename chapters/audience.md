# Audience

Naturally, the book is aimed at F# developers who wish to use their existing knowledge and skills in F# to build front-end apps. Except for a bit of Html and CSS, no prior experience is assumed concerning front-end development as I will to try to explain the concepts needed from the very scratch. 

This book however is *not* an introduction to F# itself and I will assume you know the language, to some degree at least.
