# Audience

Naturally, the book is aimed at F# developers who wish to use their existing knowledge and skills in F# to build frontend apps. No prior experience is assumed concerning frontend developement as I will to try to explain the concepts needed from the very scratch.

That said, anyone who is familiar with the syntax of the ML family of languages like [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason) or [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) should be able to follow along with the book.

Develpers of a foreign language like [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) might be interested in F# because of it's elegant functional nature, the powerful type system and the deep integration with the Javascript tools. 
 
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) developers in particular might find F# with Fable a truely delightful experience, here are some of the reasons why, F#:
 - Is a general-purpose functional language with a huge community 
 - Can be used both on client and server and share code between the two
 - Is very close to Elm syntactically
 - Has excellent tooling, both [open source](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp) and [professional](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) backed by Microsoft
 - Provides The Elm architecture implemented as a library: Elmish
 - Can reuse the vast existing Javascript ecosystem of components, UI and pure libraries alike in Elmish applications.
